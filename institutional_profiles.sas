/*Institutional Profiles Data Pull*/
/*Author: Jimmy Luong*/
/*Last Updated: July 2020 */

***********************************************************************************************;

/*Purpose of Code: Generate tables to be used in institutional profile graphs*/

/*TABLES GENERATED:*/
/*work.success_table: Contains data on success outcomes. */
/*work.credits_table: Contains data on credits target and credits delivered*/
/*work.senior_phase_table: Contains data on senior phase pupils studying vocational qualifications*/
/*work.HNC_HND_Table: Contains data on successful students achieving HNC or HND qualifications*/
/*work.gender_table: Contains data on enrolments by gender at each college.*/
/*work.BME_table: Contains data on enrolments by ethnicity at each college*/
/*work.disability_table: Contains data on enrolments by disability at each college*/
/*work.age_table: Contains data on enrolments by age group at each college*/

/* METHOD: */
/* 1. SAS DATA STEP to query library tables for 5 academic years */
/* 2. Combine tables with PROC SQL UNION */
/* 3. Run a SAS DATA step to format columns of interest. */
/* 4. Run various PROC SQL CREATE TABLE statements to produce data input tables for graphs.*/
/* 5. Export the tables to .csv files.*/
